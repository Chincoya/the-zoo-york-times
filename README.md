## New York Times article clone.

This repository contains a clone of an article page from [the New York Times site.](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html) In this project, made for the Microverse Program, we used:

 - Advanced CSS selectors.
 - Grid
 - Flexbox
 - Pseudoclass selectors
 - And a tiny bit of javascript. c:
